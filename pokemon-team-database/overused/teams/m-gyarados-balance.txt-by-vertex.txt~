i tried a more offensive build and it didn't work out because of compounding
weaknesses and then a bulky offense build but still failed to perform its duties
and secure win conditions. i then had to work my way to boring balance which is
the only way this core is gonna work but remains effective nonetheless. skarmory
+ hippowdon is a defensive core that blanket checks a bunch of the metagame like
how skarmbliss did in dpp. threats that could muscle threw such as sd bisharp
could be combated by gyarados. running crunch / eq is possible to provide a
better check to bisharp but bulky grounds can get annoying. kyurem-b had
horrible defensive synergy with gyarados so i had to abuse the offensive synergy
they had and run 2 more defensive 'mons. clefable is the primary fighting resist
and provides a secondary win condition with calm mind. flamethrower clefable is
used because ferrothorn and mega scizor are still nuiscances and it provides a
secondary lure to them because let's face it: flamethrower clefable is not
nearly as popular. i landed my way to starmie as a water and fighting resist,
spinner, and provides much needed speed. skarmory + hippowdon adds those hazards
to abuse cube's ability to force switches and help dos sweep. the team performs
nicely but just watch out for specific stallbreakers, most notably mega sableye,
haxorus, and mew. sd tflame is a threat too so rocky helmet hippowdon is an
option while also shuffling more damage to lopunny. hope you have fun n_n
