Alright so the core was pretty weak to mostly every physically oriented threat
there is in the metagame so Landorus-T was added as the check to them as well as
being the Stealth Rocker of the team. Klefki is the fairy-type check to stuff
like M-Gardevoir, M-Diancie, etc and acts as the spikes stacker and emergency
T-Waver if things go out of hand. M-Sceptile was given Earthquake to hit the
likes of AV Raikou, Heatran, and Klefki while the rest of the moves are pretty
standard. Starmie's set is pretty standard too and is pretty important for the
team as it breaks down the likes of Heatran and checks stuff like Keldeo,
Gengar, Hippowdon, and scares out a lot of things that the team hates. Infernape
was given a Mixed spread and Gunk Shot which does a ton, almost OHKOes every
fairy there is, to lure them in. Mach Punch is an option over U-Turn but it's
not very necessary. Finally, AV Raikou was added to deal with stuff like M-
Manectric, Thundurus-I and needed another decent switch in to Keldeo so Raikou
looked like a good fit, it also added VoltTurn to the team which is pretty nice.
Threats would include DD Zard-X and Y, DD Dragonite, Specs Keldeo, M-
Manectric+Weavile, SD Talonflame and SD Bisharp all of whom pressure the team to
quite an extent after setting up.
