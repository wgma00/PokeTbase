This core need more than anything the right support because both mons are really
offensive and frails, so for doing work needs safety switch ins. Focus in that
way I add max speed to bisharp because as I say before is frail either way so
Max Speed bisharp is the way to go, next in my mind i though one pokemon than
can safety switch in agaisnt Priority like Brave Bird from Talon, Bullet Punch
from Scizor which are the most common checks of Garde and Bisharp can't do
nothing in return to this mons, so i pick the always beloved Rotom-W this
little washing machine can deal with a whole lot threats in the OU metagame
nonetheless can't switch to all of them, but in this case we need to cover
Scizor + talon and Wash does the job, I though in Bulky chomp too but then I
realize that there are no many electric switch ins bar hippowdon but then the
team become too pasive and too slow so i add Garchomp but the Scarf set this
provide a electric immunity + revenge killer for stuff like Mega Kazam, Lopu,
mega mane, gengar ( we are kinda weak to this mon but as you see every mon in
the team can take one hit, and bisharp force the 50/50 ), etc. Also this mon
still has really nice bulk to take some priority moves and complete the Fairy/
Steel/Dragon core. Next i need rocks in the team so i choose celebi for the
job, Celebi gives the team T-wave support and bulk to take any hit and spread
paralysis and a switch in for Keldeo, Lopu, even can take +3 Ice Beam from
Manaphy, etc. So i look up the team and was weak to Fairies like altaria and
Kyub, the solution was Scizor and i choose the Choice Band Set you can go
alternative with AV but i think for this team you need the power, Scizor also
give us the Volt-Turn core for get safe switch in into Garde or Bisharp, since
Rotom forces lati@s, and scizor force bulky mons than Garde destroy, in the
last slot if u feel hazard are too much put defog. Also Scizor give us a
secondary check for Weavile and some other fast threats like Kazam, gengar,
etc. Just watch out for Gengar, Lopu, Weavile, Opposing Bisharp u have checks
but in ORAS there are to many threats to prepare for it.
PD: i think Timid Gardevoir is better.

Alternatives

Hippowdon > Garchomp
This change provide u a solid answer to electric types, as well rocks, and a
switch for physical type attacker but since we lose speed there are another
change so the team cant lose sinergy or balance.
