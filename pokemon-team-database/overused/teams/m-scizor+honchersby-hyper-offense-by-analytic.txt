So the core was pretty weak to Fairies and Water-types in general. M-Scizor was added as it occupied the Mega-slot and gave the team a potential win condition in its Bulky Swords Dance set. Checked stuff like M-Diancie, M-Metagross, M-Gardevoir, M-Altaria, and Azumarill, U-Turn on it is an option too. Latios was added as my water resist and check to Keldeo as well as the hazard remover, Surf was used because Heatran was annoying to switch into although Roost / HP Fire(for M-Scizor) is an option too. Landorus-T was added as the hazard setter and a check to DD ZardX, Excadrill and Scizor and was the start of the Volt-Turn core. Raikou was added mainly due to how weak the team was to M-Manectric and Thundurus as well as checking Tornadus-T, which is annoying to the team,(Knock Off+Heat Wave variants) and completed the Volt-Turn core. Threats include DD Zard-X, Specs Keldeo, CB/BD Azumarill, Tornadus-T and M-Manectric+Weavile.

Enjoy :) Team did decently on high ladder so it shouldn't have a lot of problems standing its ground in mid 1600s. S/o to -Snow
