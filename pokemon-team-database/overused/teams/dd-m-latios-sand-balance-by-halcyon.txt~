Don't blame me if Mega Latios does absolutely nothing in matches with this team.
It's 100% garbage.

DD Mega Latios is completely outclassed in every way by Mega Altaria and Mega
Charizard X. There is nothing that it does better than those two mons except be
a bit faster I guess. I went with 192 Speed because no Latios should ever lose
to a Garchomp, that's just inhumane. The rest goes in HP for some added bulk.
Changed Scarf Ttar's coverage move to Ice Punch because Lando-t is a pain to the
core. Excadrill is SD because the only way Lati is sweeping is if all its checks
are at 30% or below, so I need some power on the team. Manaphy was a cool option
for luring Ferrothorn and Rotom-W, since both those mons shit on the core as is.
Tangrowth works as an Azu check and is the primary Keldeo check as well due to
Latios not being a good one anymore since if it gets burnt it's even more
useless than normal. Finally, Heatran checks Clefable and Scizor, which are
major threats to the team without it. It also provides SR, which I always seem
to forget to use until the last second. Threats to the team are probably belly
Azu, Lopunny, and Superpower Torn-T. You will find 90% of this team's strengths
lie in the Manaphy Tangrowth core, with Lati doing next to nothing. If you want
to make this team better, go for bulky dd altaria>mega Lati or Mega Mane>Lati.
Either one would be miles better than what you have now. Still, it's what you
wanted, and it functions decently as a team. Enjoy!
