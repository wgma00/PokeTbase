I will admit, I didn't try as hard with this core simply due to the fact that I
have used Abomasnow before and it always disappoints me in terms of power. I
always expect it to hit way harder than it does. but EQ can lure in Tran I
suppose to SD Wisp Talon makes perfect sense. Talon also lures in Tar and burns
it, making life easier for Aboma. Terakkion is a nice rock resist, while
appreciating Talon's ability to switch into bulky Faries. It hits ridicuously
hard and can usually break walls down enough for talon to sweep. Stamie provides
spin and a reliable answer to Keldeo. Hippo checks electric types, Lopunny, and
Exca while setting up rocks. FInaly, Scizor checks Lati and also serves as a
backup check to fairies such as diancie which talon can't check. Still, this
team is fun so I hope you like it too.
