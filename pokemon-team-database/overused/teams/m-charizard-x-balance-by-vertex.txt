i had a lot of trouble with this core and had talks with Ice Lunch, asdfCookie,
and bludz. none of the suggestions or mine really brought myself to a conclusion
on how i'm gonna build around crawdaunt because your core restrained me to mega
charizard x which gave me no flexibility in my mega slot. mainly crawdaunt has
peak performance with mega manectric and mega scizor and not being able to use
those two sucked. a more offensive build was ideal. tornadus-t brings crawdaunt
in to wreck havoc and checks a bunch of stuff like serperior which will
steamroll through the core. with latios i have a keldeo check and defog support.
it also brings in steels for zardx to abuse. hippowdon was added because i
needed rocks and an electric check outside of zardx which is actually rather
frail on sdef. ferrothorn checks gyara and gives me something to switchin on
meteors and dd m-alt. it also provdes spikes for daunt, latios, torn-t, and
zardx all to abuse. the team is very straight forward. crawdaunt is used to
suffice your creativity but the team will work much better with keldeo >
crawdaunt swimply because it is bulkier and provides a bisharp and more solid
weavile check. azumarill can also be used over crawdaunt and can sweep with
belly drum + hazard support. icy wind is on torn-t for luring chomp to help
crawdaunt but if you're using keldeo, you don't need it and can use superpower
or something. enjoy ^.^
