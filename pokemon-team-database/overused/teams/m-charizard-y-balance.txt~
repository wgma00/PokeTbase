Char-Y + Latias means I have two mons that love to be ScarfTar food, means I'm
using Defog to remove hazards when I rather have Rapid Spin + Hazards to
actually pressure the meta instead of relying solely on rock damage. So with
that said you provided the most boring core in existence and as such I have
provided you the most boring team I've made all week. Let's celebrate!

Back to reality. I wanted bulky Starmie cause as previously stated I think teams
or at least balance ones function a whole lot better with hazards or some other
aspect other than Stealth Rock for residual damage, Scald helps with players
second guessing throwing out their Pursuit trappers. Gives the team a much
needed Keldeo switch in as well while using Psychic for Defensive M-Venusaur,
Rotom-W, and STAB to threaten Keldeo and other Psychic prone mons. Tank Chomp +
Spikes Ferro is a pretty standard hazard + residual core to pressure contact
attackers along with applying hazard pressure throughout the game. I think Fire
Blast is better on this version to threaten Mega Scizor but if you play in a
tournament or something to that degree I'd keep Toxic as an option for Mega
Slowbro which is an underrated threat in the meta. Thunder Wave Ferro is for
speed control seeing as how the team is primarily slow against most offense
along with crippling predicted Zard switch ins. Timid Zard-Y so you're not
Manaphy fodder and autolose to all the Base 100s running speed nature like M-
Gardevoir after you get rocks damage. HexGar is more or less the Clefable check
and stallbreaker on this team. Scarftar is scarftar, thought about using
Weavile, but needed a secondary check to Talonflame and to an extent
necessitated a Lati and switch in to stuff like M-Manectric. You can use a
stronger Garchomp variant such as Attack and speed with Adamant nature, same
item, but with Dragon Claw > Dragon Tail and Swords Dance over Fire Blast /
Toxic to pressure mixed Clefable who like to switch into Chomp a lot.

Enjoy.
