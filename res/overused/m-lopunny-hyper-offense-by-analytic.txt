So, I really liked this core and how it fared against most team archetypes. So
the core was pretty weak to physical threats, TankChomp was a nice addition to
the team to check the likes of Bisharp, Talonflame, and get chip damage on
threats like M-CharizardX and M-Altaria. Specs Keldeo looked like a really big
threat now so AV Tornadus-T was added as a more than decent switch in to it and
it checked things like M-Gardevoir, the Lati twins, and just gave the team a
nice pivot in general. CM Manaphy was added because I felt like the team needed
a Pokemon with offensive and defensive presence at the same time and also needed
something to get off damage on a +1 M-ZardX / M-Altaria and have another check
to Keldeo. It appreciates Pursuit-trapping from Bisharp so that it has an easier
time against opposing teams and CM+Rest is a pretty cool set imo, and very
underrated atm. Threats to the team are: M-CharizardX, DD M-Altaria, SubCM
Keldeo, (Nasty Plot) Thundurus-I, and annoying stuff to the team include
TankChomp and Rotom-W, hence I'd suggest trying out Ice Punch on Lopunny and SD
on Bisharp. Enjoy :)
