First thing's first, sorry Komet3, cause I totally changed the sets in your
core. I don't think 4 attacks Mega Ampharos takes advantage of what it does in
the meta well enough. RestTalk puts Ampharos's amazing bulk to use, while still
hitting about the same special attack as a Latios. Skarmory has nice synergy
with Ampharos, covering Landorus-T, Hippo, and Fairies, but Brave Bird misses
out on key coverage against the fairies it's supposed to beat. SO I went with
Iron Head instead, and changes SR to Spikes because I thought Spikes would suit
the constant volt switching from Ampharos well. Azu is fine, checks certain
dragons like Zard X, but it's still a sheky check so you need to watch out for
it. These mons all handle the counters to Serperior well, so it was a logical
next choice. Azu can check Heatran, Amphy checks Talon and Torn, while Skarm
checks Weavile and Torn. I went with Knock Off because with Spikes and
constantly switching into Ampharos, Heatran can be worn down pretty fast in
case I don't want to switch in Azu on a burn. Keldeo was a goon check to
offensive Scizor and secondary check to Weavile, since Skarm can get worn down
pretty easily. Finally, I didn't want Skarm to be my only fairy check. I needed
something besides Skarm for Gardevoir, which 6-0ed me if it carried Taunt and
predicted Roost correctly. Other threats to the team included Mega Lopunny,
and certain electric types. Jirachi fit the bill, and could pass wishes to the
other members of my team if needed. Plus, who doesn't like having Body Slam
against faster teams? Threats to the teams would be Keldeo, which the team
doesn't have any true counters to, but plenty of checks, Zard X, which gets up a
DD and wins if Azu is weakened, and possibly Manectric if Ampharos is weakened.
