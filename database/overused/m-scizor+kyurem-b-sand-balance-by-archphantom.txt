I took your core cause sub KB needs more love. To start off, I added a sand
component mainly cause (I LOVE SAND) sand deals with things the core struggles
with such as birdspam and offense. Also, nuisances to sand such as Rotom-W,
Slowbro and Skarmory are taken care of by KB. Next, Tornadus-T was a needed
switch in to Gengar, Zam, Serperior and Lati@s. It works well with KB since it
lures in stuff that give Cube a free sub. Finally, I slapped Roost Latios on to
not get charred by Char-Y and to have a decent check to Manaphy and Keldeo.

Because Scizor is a threat to this team, I maxed out HP on Tornadus to take a +2
BP from Scizor after rocks at full health + gave Drill a Life Orb. At first
Latios was Roost w/ three attacks but after some games, I noticed a Mega Bro
weakness (I.e, nearly got dropped by M Bro), so I made it CM-Roost-Draco-HP
Fire. The set is cool because it lures in steels thinking it's the standard CM
roost stabs lati. HP Fire over Psyshock is cause Scizor is a big ass threat to
this build. An alternative is to give Hippo Toxic (or do smth with another
member that lets it beat random shit you find out you're weak to) and go w/
Roost three attacks Lati so you can actually touch Azumarill and force Clef and
Chansey to recover lol. Yeah, you might wanna be able to touch Azu now that I
look at it... Rash>Mild KB cause it's my Gyara counter tho if it makes waters
and elecs break your sub, do change back. Enjoy n_n
