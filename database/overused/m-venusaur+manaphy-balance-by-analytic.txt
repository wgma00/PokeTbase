So the core was pretty weak to SD Talonflame, Charizard-Y/X, M-Gardevoir and the
team needed a rocks setter so Heatran was added. Also forms the FWG core along
with being the stall-breaker of the team. The team still looked weak to
Charizard Y and Specs Keldeo as M-Venusaur could be worn down pretty easily with
a Scald burn or hazards so Latios was added, also functioned as the hazard
controller for the team and provided Defog support. ScarfTar was added as the
team looked susceptible to being pressured by Latios and Manaphy appreciates the
Pursuit-trapping that gets rid of the Lati twins and is a solid check to stuff
like Raikou, Thundurus and M-Manectric. Finally, Hippowdon was added as I didn't
like how the team was weak to Bisharp and how easily fast electric-types wore it
down so it was added to stop their momentum. The team was also weak to LO/Mega
Alakazam so I chose Crunch although, Toxic is an option too. Threats to the team
include SD Bisharp, Manaphy+Pursuit support, Kyurem-B, Charizard+Pursuit support
and M-Gardevoir.
