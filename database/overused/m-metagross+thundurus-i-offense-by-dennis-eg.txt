Hey viejo, the core scream offense so i build an offensive team with this
specially when i see Volt switch in Thundurus, so immediatly come to my mind Volt
-Turn core with some powerhouses but still have the balance at least to switch
in a couple threats or check them. I add Lando-T scarf for the volt-turn core
because intimidate help a lot against Lopu, metagross after mega evol etc, also
this is my ground resist to avoid those nasty Mega manetric volt turns, this
core also fuction as a Bird resist / check but since is offense you can't have a
solid answer. Next thing i've notice that im really weak to weavile, so i added
the ultimate offensive counter wich is keldeo, but is a set not too common at
all which is Rest Talk Keldeo with LO, really underated set or maybe people
thinks is bad but for this team fit really well also is your status absorber,
also is our Bisharp check. After that a realize tha we haven't rocks and if
stall give us some trouble i put Magma Heatran for the job, I like air baloon
cuz u can taunt hippo turn 1 and then trapped if you dont choose to run defog,
also is a secondary partner for Metagross to get rid of Steels, enough Speatk to
2hko Sableye with magma + recoil, leftovers is another option to bluff ur the
spedef tran and people like to switch sableye prevent rocks, so u can catch it.
And last i add the mandotory Keldeo / Water resist check which is Latias, u can
go with defog + healing to support ur other mons or defog + roost for longetivy.

Alternatives

Azumarill > Latias

Assault Vest Azu acomplish almost the same than Latias except for defog support,
but this give you another Weavile check + dragon immunity, i tested both ways
and i like the result i get.
