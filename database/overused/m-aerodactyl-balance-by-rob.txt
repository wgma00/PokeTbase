First go around I wasn't focused enough on this project before and it showed in
the final product; so I'll take more time when releasing these to make sure
they're actually decent. The first thing I noticed about the original core of
Alakazam and Mega Aero was that both pokemon have trouble dealing with steels.
The ones that cause them the most problems are jirachi, bisharp, scizor,
heatran, and ferrothorn. Since both are great at attracting steels Magnezone was
added to trap them with magnet pull. I opted for Substitute + Life Orb Magnezone
for more flexibility on offense and when trapping, to prevent it from being
useless outside of trapping 1 or 2 steels. You have to make a couple double
switches against most teams when you feel as though they might bring in their
steel type (against zam, aero, or clef), but the team is built in such a way
that this will be easily to accomplish. Chesnaught was added as a defensive
stopper to physical steel types as well as other threats, it's a great defensive
mon that can disrupt a lot of popular strategies thanks to its utility and
typing. Chesnaught's Spikes help weaken walls, which is highly appreciated by
mega aero and alakazam. I gave Chesnaught some investment in special defense to
help against electrics. Rotom-W is a nuisance, so adding Wood Hammer over Spiky
Shield or Leech Seed would probably help the team function a little better.
Clefable was added to compliment Chesnaught and to pick up where it lacks
defensively. Clefable also carries Stealth Rock > Flamethrower. I felt this was
okay since the team has Magnezone to trap steels but if you would feel more
comfortable using flamethrower, give Aero SR > Roost. I needed a reliable hazard
remover so I added Starmie to the team since it has recovery and a great move (
Reflect Type) that gives it a way of dealing with mon's that would otherwise
counter it. Charizard X is annoying so it's best to switch aggressively when
your opponent has a zard.
