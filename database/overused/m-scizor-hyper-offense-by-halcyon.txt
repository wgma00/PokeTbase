Initially had some difficulty with this team. The backbone I used ended up being
way too semi-stall and didn't fit the initial core very well and ended up being
very weak to Zard Y and Lati. This version of the team is much more fun and
effective. I decided to go with HP Ground Volc since Buzz doesn't really hit
much and the rest of the team kinda struggles with Tran. I went with Lati
because of how rocks weak the team was and Latios provided a switch-in to Keldeo
and Zard Y, which are problems for the core. Scizor helps against opposing Lati,
Azu, and Altaria, which are also problematic. It also appreciates Volc's ability
to lure Heatran and possibly Keldeo (though most people assume giga now right?).
Landorus-T provides SR support, while also checking sand Exca and Zard X.
Finally, Raikou serves as a check to Torn and opposing Electrics, while also
being able to sweep when stuff like Heatran is lured by Volc and Kyurem-B
weakens Ferrothorn. DD Fire Blast Altaria shits on this team, so be sure to
scout for it before blindly SDing in front of an Altaria. other scizor become a
problem if volc is weakened, HP Fire Lati as well, though baiting it into Draco
can give Volc a setup opportunity.
