Mega Charizard X + Manaphy seemed best fit on an offensively inclined team, so I
decided to build a Bulky Offensive squad. Landorus-T is a great Stealth Rock
setter for offensive teams, being capable of taking on a plethora of physical
attackers. It was my choice over Garchomp because i didn't want to stack Dragon-
types, as being weak to Ice- and Dragon-types isn't the best idea in a metagame
filled with Lati@s, Kyurem-B, and Weavile. Skamory was added to provide type-
resistance to Dragon-, Fairy-, and Flying-types, stopping the likes of Lati@s,
Tornadus-T, and Clefable from plowing through the team. Latias removes hazards
for Charizard thanks to Defog, and provides a much needed resistance to Water-
and Fighting-type attacks. Latios is an option over Latias, if you would like
the extra power over the added bulk Latias provides. The last member of the
team, Conkeldurr, was added to break holes for Charizard or Manaphy to sweep.
Using the uncommon Life Orb set, it is capable of 2HKOing Hippowdon, and dealing
tons of damage to Pokemon like Clefable and Mega SAbleye. You can also use Bulk
Up or Assault Vest on Conkeldurr, which increases its longevity, but personally
i prefer the wallrbeaking power this set offers.
