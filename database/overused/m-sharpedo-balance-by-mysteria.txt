I will admit I had to go back to the drawing board a couple times with this
core. However, after a bunch of mental frustration I was able to build a team
around it which I am happy with. A lot of the team is based around weakening the
opposition enough for Sharpedo to come in and clean up, which is a pretty easy
strategy and as such make the team a lot easier to use. On to the team itself:
Rocky Helmet Garchomp imo is kind of a must for teaming up with Mega Sharpedo;
in one slot, it weakens the opposition by setting up Stealth Rocks and punishing
physical attackers with 30% damage which with stealth rocks equals minimum 36%
damage which is all the better for sharpedo cleaning up after. I then put AV
Tornadus-T as it is an excellent source of chip damage with U-turn and Hurricane
as well as providing excellent utility with Knock Off. It also is a great
partner to Garchomp as Garchomp keeps most physical attackers in check while
Tornadus-T does a good job at keeping special attackers in check. At this point,
I noticed that the team was really weak to Clefable and stall in general, so I
put Taunt Gengar as it beats Clefable with ease and can punish Stall really
easily. Shadow Ball and Sludge Wave from Gengar also are both really powerful in
general and dent teams really easily as its coverage is unresisted and those who
can stand up to its attacks are bopped by Taunt. Talonflame finishes up a FWG
core and the SD variant is especially helpful for this team as it provides a
secondary win condition outside of Sharpedo. If it's not going to be used during
a match as a win condition, it keeps Mega Metagross and Mega Altaria in check (
the latter which 6-0s otherwise) and provides very powerful priority that takes
advantage of weakened opposing Pokemon. Hopefully this team is good for your
tastes, I tried many different things such as Weavile + Heatran > Garchomp and
Talonflame but after a bunch of tweaking this is the end result.
