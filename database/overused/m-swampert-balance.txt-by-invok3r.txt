Hey man, here is the team I made for you around ur torn-t mega swampert core! :D

I feel like curse swamp is a decent set which can sweep unprepared teams, especially if u can lure steels with handy hp fire latios. The core firstly has some issues with mons like kyurem-b, mega lopunny, and latios is an annoyance. Because of this I added chople ttar, which lives lopunny hjk after rocks and can ohko with superpower. Ttar also gives me sr support, and can lure in cocky tank chomps with ice beam, helping swamp/exca attempt to sweep later on. I chose exca in the next slot since i needed some more speed control, and I wanted a way to remove hazards. Next I went with amoonguss, since I needed a solid fairy and water resist, and the mushroom fit that role perfectly. Lastly I added magnezone to remove skarm and ferro, but I later changed to hp fire latios which can lure those 2 while checking zardy. Shoutouts to bludz for helping me build and test the team! :D
