The original core is really cool, and leaves a lot of options when it comes to
building around it. Getting rid of Dark-types should be the #1 priority when
using mono-attacking Mega Latias. Defensive Infernape was my choice as Dark-type
check, as it, between Will-O-Wisp, Encore and STAB Low Kick is capable of
dealing with almost every Dark-type in existance. The original core was also
weak to opposing Dragon-types, which is why Clefable was added. I chose to go
with Thunder Wave + Calm Mind due to Manaphy being an issue, but what version of
Clefable you use is up to you. Unaware Clefable can be used too, but the team
gets weaker to Lati@s that way. To handle physical attackers, oppoing Clefable,
and other Fairt-types, I added Hippowdon + Excadrill. Hippowdon is simply put a
great mixed wall, capable of dealing with everything from Mega Charizard X to
Tornadus-T. Excadrill Rapid Spin's for the team, and with Swords Dance + Air
Balloon, it can pressure Landorus-T and opposing Hippowdon trying to keep
Stealth Rock up.
